This project was realised by myself, Robertson OSCAR in collaboration with Dylan FAURE, Luca BANYOLS, Falvien THEL in 2019

It's a Role Player Game we made with passion in C using the SFML library

You control a character that has to defeat ennemies and bosses to achieve the final boss and unlock the endgame.

The world is composed of a shop, monsters and different maps. There are 2 different fighting style. The strategy turn by turn for bosses and the outside fighting style with the starball skill.

Here are a few screens from the game
